# Fraud-Detection Project

## Description
This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of transaction records, and various features are engineered to improve the model's performance. The project utilizes Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers to identify fraudulent activities.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- imbalanced-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn imbalanced-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage
1. Load the dataset by placing the `.pkl` files in the `dataset/data` directory.
2. Run the `fraud_detection.ipynb` Jupyter notebook to execute the analysis and model training.
